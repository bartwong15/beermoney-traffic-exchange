 WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS (please read carefully)
 ============================================
 please submit (up to 10) ImgSpice links.  If you are using a link shortener ONLY USE LINKBUCKS.
 This is stated in ImgSpice TOS.
 Other supported link shorteners for other sites: Adf.ly, Adfoc.us.
 Not thoroughly tested, but possibly: Ysear.ch

How it works
============
The idea of this program is to take advantage of sites that pay per viewer.  For example,
ImgSpice pays up to $3.50 per 1000 unique hits.  This software automatically surfs through
a list of websites from each users' computer. The list of websites is a combination of each
links that each user generates and uploads. Thus, each user will generate clicks for the 
other users.  So for example, if we have 100 users, and each user submits 10 links.  Then
if each person runs the software each day, every link will be clicked and viewed once, for
a total of 1000 views per user, which could be up to $3.50 per day.
